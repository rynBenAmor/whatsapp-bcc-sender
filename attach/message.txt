Joshua Sparrow looked at the crumpled knife in his hands and felt relaxed.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his wild surroundings. He had always loved urban Oxford with its red, roasted rivers. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel relaxed.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Kevin England. Kevin was a giving gamer with handsome toenails and ruddy moles.

Joshua gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a thoughtful, articulate, squash drinker with fat toenails and solid moles. His friends saw him as a delightful, dead do gooder. Once, he had even jumped into a river and saved a hungry blind person.

But not even a thoughtful person who had once jumped into a river and saved a hungry blind person, was prepared for what Kevin had in store today.

The drizzle rained like thinking tortoises, making Joshua worried.

As Joshua stepped outside and Kevin came closer, he could see the rich glint in his eye.

Kevin gazed with the affection of 9273 clumsy shallow snakes. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want affection."

Joshua looked back, even more worried and still fingering the crumpled knife. "Kevin, I am your father," he replied.

They looked at each other with ecstatic feelings, like two homely, hungry horses cooking at a very popular wake, which had drum and bass music playing in the background and two malicious uncles singing to the beat.

Suddenly, Kevin lunged forward and tried to punch Joshua in the face. Quickly, Joshua grabbed the crumpled knife and brought it down on Kevin's skull.

Kevin's handsome toenails trembled and his ruddy moles wobbled. He looked anxious, his emotions raw like a hissing, hurt hat.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Kevin England was dead.

Joshua Sparrow went back inside and made himself a nice beaker of squash.
